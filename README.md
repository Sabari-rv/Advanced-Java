<p>A web application is built considering the following scenario.<br>
Assume a driver (user) is caught by a police while violating the driving rules. Then, the police is providing him/her a login portal and asked the driver to submit the name and age. If the age is below 18 then the police has to report as “  Warning: You are not eligible for Driving”. Otherwise, each time the user is caught, then the police has a count on the particular user. If the user is caught third time then the police cancel his/her driving license, reported as ”DL CANCELLED ” along with date and time.</p>
